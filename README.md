# Phar's Archipelago SM64 Randomizer PopTracker Pack

This includes all the source code necessary to build my pack and any of the relevant JSON, Lua, and image files.

This also includes a CLI tool I developed for automatically building, packaging, and versioning my pack. For a list of
all known flags, run:

```shell
python ./main.py -h
```

## Requirements

Python 3.12 is officially supported. Older versions may work, but I make no guarantees. No additional python 
dependencies are required.

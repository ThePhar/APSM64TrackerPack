## Bug Reports

This is my first time creating such a pack, so if you notice any issues or bugs, please 
[create an issue](https://github.com/ThePhar/APSM64TrackerPack/issues/new/choose) for me to investigate and include the 
exported state, the pack version, your PopTracker version, and what your expectations were.

## Compiling from Source

This pack is built via a TypeScript CLI tool I created called Phakager, which is included in this repo. To use, install 
the latest version of Bun and your package manager of choice (I used `pnpm`), then run install (e.g., `pnpm install`) in
the directory to download all dependencies.

Then run `bun run ./Phakager.ts -h` to see all the possible options that can be run.
